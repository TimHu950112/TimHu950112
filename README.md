### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am Tingfeng Hu, from Taipei Municipal Cheng Gong Senior High School. My parents run a bakery in Keelung, and due to the large volume of business, they often spend a lot of time on repetitive tasks. I always think about how to solve various problems in life. This led me to embark on the path of learning programming. Due to the busy schoolwork at the time and frequent assistance at the bakery during weekends, I had limited time for formal programming courses. As a result, most of my programming skills were self-taught through online resources and books. This experience has instilled in me a spirit of perseverance. I believe that even without a teacher's guidance, I can carve out a niche in the field of programming.
